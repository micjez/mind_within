# About

Hi!

My name is Michal, and I'm a software developer and an engineering manager from Poland. Outside my professional life, I delve into topics such as wisdom, meaning, nonduality, mind, consciousness, embodiment, and phenomenological experience. It all started with John Vervaeke's *Awakening from Meaning Crisis*, and my recent inspiration comes from work of Michael Levin, Bernardo Kastrup, Robert Lawrence Kuhn, Curt Jaimungal, and many others.

My plan is to challenge my own understanding of fundamental notions of time, space, causality, and the self. I'm going to post here findings from my reading, experiments, and musings.

I'm just getting started and I’m learning as I go in the topics I'm planning to write about, but hey, everyone starts somewhere.

I hope one day this place will transform into a deep dive into consciousness exploration. For sure it's going to be the entry point into my mind.

Can't wait to start this journey, and I'm so happy you are part of it. If you enjoy reading, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:hello@michaljezynski.com).
