For the last two years, I've been experimenting with dancing, but my whole life I struggled with a poor sense of rhythm. Or at least that's what my parents told me, and I believed them. Recently, I bought a cheap Chinese MIDI device, and it's so much fuuuun!

Since the beginning of this year, I've been taking online salsa classes with my girlfriend, and I decided that improving my sense of timing would take our fun to a whole new level.

Before that, I had a couple of attempts at learning rhythm with apps. I also bought a ukulele as a portable and easy-to-learn instrument, but my progress was very slow, all my neighbors could hear every note, so finally I gave up after a couple of lessons.

So I wanted to try something different. My friends who play in rock bands inspired me to check out percussion. I learned about electronic drum kits, but because I have many abandoned hobbies, I wanted to mess around with something cheap.

I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxkRAM4ox5o) of finger drumming on MIDI pads, and I immediately fell in love. Especially because I can program this device to be any instrument or sample. I found this beast and decided to give it a try:

It's a $40 [Chinese M-VAVE MIDI](https://pl.aliexpress.com/item/1005007209943393.html) controller. Many people complained that the pads might be too insensitive for finger drumming. I had the same issue and had to press them much harder than I liked. I even thought about returning it. This is a known problem and some people [hack it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5knDHVOgrA) by adding a tape layer under the pads to improve sensitivity. I managed to change the sensitivity in **MidiSuite** and mashed the pads a bit, and now they are fine most of the time.

I cannot say much about the device itself, because I'm so excited to practice finger drumming that I haven't played around with all its options. A cool feature is the built-in battery and Bluetooth. The latency is negligible, and I'm quite confident I could use it, if not for the lag in my Bluetooth headphones.

This is my first MIDI device, and to make it work I followed [Nifox](https://www.reddit.com/r/KoalaSampler/comments/1ibu6ey/nifoxs_smc_pad_presets_for_koala_sampler_tutorial/) instructions on how to configure the SMC PAD with [Koala Sampler](https://www.koalasampler.com/) on my Android smartphone. I didn't even need to install MIDI Hub, but used the free version of [MIDI BLE Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobileer.example.midibtlepairing) instead. 

The nice surprise for Linux nerds like me, there is also [Koala Sampler for Linux](https://www.elf-audio.com/koala/linux.php). I haven't had any problems with it so far, and the best part is that it's free.

I've had this device for about a week and I practice daily with the [Quest for Groove Beginner Course](https://questforgroove.com). Today was my first lesson with drum fills. I'm excited to share my practice and see how I improve over a year.
